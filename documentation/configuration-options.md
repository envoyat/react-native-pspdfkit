### Configuration Options

Here's the complete list of configuration options supported by each platform. Note that some options are only supported on a single platform â€” that's because of differences in the behavior of both of these platforms. Options that work on only one platform are prefixed with the appropriate platform name: `android` or `iOS`.

This list has now moved to the React Native API Reference. See the available configuration options here: https://pspdfkit.com/api/react-native/PDFConfiguration.html
